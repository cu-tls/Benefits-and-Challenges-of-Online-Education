What is SCORM?
SCORM stands for Shareable Content Object Reference Model. Essentially, it is a way for two different systems to talk to each other, such as the LMS and another application. This allows you to create e-learning activities outside of your LMS, but have learners access it within the course page.

How do I add a SCORM package to my course?
Similar to adding any file, there are two ways to add a SCORM package to your course.

1. Drag and drop – just like with files, you can drag and drop a zipped SCORM package into the section you wish. You must make sure that editing is turned on in order for it to work, but this is the simplest way to bring it into your course. In order to edit the appearance and other features, you must then select ‘Edit’>’Edit settings’ to the right of the file name. Details for editing will be given below.

2. SCORM package activity – with editing turned on, go to the ‘Add an activity’ drop down menu in the section you wish to add the SCORM package. From the menu, choose ‘SCORM package’ and then on the subsequent page, provide a name, description and add the file by dragging and dropping or by clicking on the ‘add’ icon at the top left of the ‘Package’ section. The rest of the editable features will be covered below.

How do I edit the appearance of a SCORM package within my course?
From the ‘Edit Settings’ page, as described in the previous FAQ, scroll down to the ‘Appearance’ section and click on it to expand. From there, you will see several options, as well as a link to ‘Show more’. These options give you a great deal of flexibility when displaying the SCORM packages, most notably with the display of menus and other navigation tools. It should be noted that if you display the package in a new window, some browsers’ pop-up blockers will block it and users may not know where to allow the pop-up window.

What are the minimum system requirements for viewing the SCORM packages?
Flash:
-Flash Player 10 or later (http://www.adobe.com/go/getflash), and one of the following browsers:

Can I view the SCORM packages on my iPhone or iPad?
The SCORM packages have been published for viewing on iPhones and iPads, however your learning management system must be optimized for viewing on iPhones and iPads. We recommend that you test this out and contact your technical support representative if you’re having trouble viewing on an iPhone or iPad.

Do the SCORM packages meet accessibility standards?
All the SCORM packages include a closed captioning option that works when viewing both the Flash-based and HTML5 outputs. The Flash-based output (but NOT the HTML5 output) includes support for:

JAWS readers
Full keyboard navigation
Visible focus indicator
How can I modify the source files for the SCORM packages?
The source files for the SCORM packages were created with a software called Articulate Storyline, and you will need a copy of the software to modify the source files. It is recommended that you have beginner to intermediate knowledge of the software in order to modify the files.
